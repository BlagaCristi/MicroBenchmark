Compile with command:
	- mcs -out:c#_benchmark c#_benchmark.cs./c#_benchmark.exe 1000 1000000 100 100 100 100

Compute elapsed time using StopWatch -> take ElapsedTicks -> divide by StopWatch frequency (OS dependent/independent)

In C#, when the Garbace Collector is called, it runs EVERY SINGLE TIME.

In order to make the bridge between the c# code and the c code, do the following:
	- write the c file in c_helper.c
	- compile it using:
		gcc -shared -o libChelper.so -fPIC c_helper.c -lpthread
			-> in order to create a dynamically shared library between the two codes
	- in c#, specify it as a DLL import with the name "Chelper.so". The "lib" prefix is used in order to be recognised by the Ubuntu OS.
