JTabbedPane model ~ each benchmark will have an individual benchmark
- 6 values needed - all must be present
- by pressing start button, java benchmark is called (has to already be compilled and everything)

- when adding a new pane, create a new panel, add it in the JTabbedPane and initialize it exactly as for JAVA_BENCHMARK
- when values are not ok, a dialog frame pops-up
