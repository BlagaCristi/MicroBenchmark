## Project Description
This project was implemented during the course of Structure of Computer Systems at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. It features an application implementing
a MicroBenchmark in three different programming languages, namely: **Java**, **C** and **C#**.

# Requirements
The development of the project was done on a VMware with **ubuntu 16** as its operating system. The VM has the following specifications:
*	2 processors with 4 cores each
*	20GB HDD
*	2GB RAM

# MicroBenchmark features
The features studied by this benchmark are:
*	Memory allocation
*	Memory deallocation
*	Memory access time (both dynamic and static)
*	Thread creation
*	Thread context switch
*	Thread migration

For a comprehensive description of the project, together with implementation details and results, please refer to the **Documentation** file.

# Running the application
The application can be run by executing the **UserInterface** file from the **java_user_interface** folder.
